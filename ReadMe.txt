This is my attempt to store my solutions of puzzles found in the internet. Basically, current project keeps solutions from such resources as:

1) CodingGame (for more information see https://codingame.com)

2) Rosalind (for more information see http://rosalind.info)

Important note: this project can store old information about puzzles and its solutions (puzzles can be added/removed/changed). More over, keep in mind that this project contains my early solutions. There was (and is) time when I wrote (and write) really crazy and stupid code! :))) 

I hope that it will help somebody.
